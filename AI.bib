	abstract = {I use administrative data on artificial intelligence ({AI}) software created in Brazil to study its effects on the labor market. Owing to a unique copyright system, Brazilian firms have registered their software with the government since the 1980s, creating a detailed record of nearly all commercial {AI} applications developed in the country. Drawing on this registry, I show that {AI} is widely used not only in administrative tasks but also in production settings, where it primarily supports process optimization and quality control. Using an instrument based on variation in software development costs, I find that {AI} affects administrative and production workers differently. Among office workers, {AI} reduces employment and wages, particularly for middle-wage earners. Among production workers, it increases employment of low-skilled and young workers operating machinery. These results suggest that {AI} displaces routine office tasks while making machines more productive and easier to operate, leading to a net increase in employment.},

title={The Innovation Premium to Soft Skills in Low-Skilled Occupations},
year={2019},
number={739},
abstract={Matched employee-employer data from the UK are used to analyze the wage premium to working in an innovative firm. We find that firms that are more R\&D intensive pay higher wages on average, and this is particularly true for workers in some low-skilled occupations. We propose a model in which a firm's innovativeness is reflected in the degree of complementarity between workers in low-skill and high-skilled occupations, and in which non-verifiable soft skills are an important determinant of the wages of workers in low-skilled occupations. The model yields additional predictions on training, tenure and outsourcing which we also find support for in data.},

In our model economy, banks can operate in two types of business à la Minsky’s narratives. They are sequentially aware of the deterioration of fundamentals of the speculative business and decide whether to continue credit extension in that business or liquidate capital and move into the traditional business. However, because individual banks face uncertainty about how many of their peers have been aware, they rationally choose to extend credit in the speculative business for a longer time than is socially optimal, leading to an over-delayed crisis and consequently more banks being caught by the crisis. This in turn renders the …nancial crisis more severe and the subsequent economic recovery slower. Within a standard textbook macroeconomic growth setting, our model generates rich dynamics of economic booms, slowdowns, crashes, and recoveries.},

To interpret these findings, we develop a model of wage setting in which workers have idiosyncratic tastes for different workplaces.

	abstract = {This paper provides evidence from the {US} and Denmark that managers with a business degree (“business managers”) reduce their employees’ wages. Within ﬁve years of the appointment of a business manager, wages decline by 6\% and the labor share by 5 percentage points in the {US}, and by 3\% and 3 percentage points in Denmark. Firms appointing business managers are not on diﬀerential trends and do not enjoy higher output, investment, or employment growth thereafter. Using manager retirements and deaths and an {IV} strategy based on the diﬀusion of the practice of appointing business managers within industry, region and size quartile cells, we provide additional evidence that these are causal eﬀects. We establish that the proximate cause of these (relative) wage eﬀects are changes in rent-sharing practices following the appointment of business managers. Exploiting exogenous export demand shocks, we show that non-business managers share proﬁts with their workers, whereas business managers do not. But consistent with our ﬁrst set of results, these business managers show no greater ability to increase sales or proﬁts in response to exporting opportunities. Finally, we use the inﬂuence of role models on college major choice to instrument for the decision to enroll in a business degree in Denmark and show that our estimates correspond to causal eﬀects of practices and values acquired in business education—rather than the diﬀerential selection into business education of individuals unlikely to share rents with workers.},

            We use a massive, matched employer-employee database for the United States to analyze the contribution of firms to the rise in earnings inequality from 1978 to 2013. We find that one-third of the rise in the variance of (log) earnings occurred within firms, whereas two-thirds of the rise occurred due to a rise in the dispersion of average earnings between firms. However, this rising between-firm variance is not accounted for by the firms themselves but by a widening gap between firms in the composition of their workers. This compositional change can be split into two roughly equal parts: high-wage workers became increasingly likely to work in high-wage firms (i.e., sorting increased), and high-wage workers became increasingly likely to work with each other (i.e., segregation rose). In contrast, we do not find a rise in the variance of firm-specific pay once we control for the worker composition in firms. Finally, we find that two-thirds of the rise in the within-firm variance of earnings occurred within mega (10,000+ employee) firms, which saw a particularly large increase in the variance of earnings compared with smaller firms.},

	doi = {10.1016/s0169-7218(11)02410-5},
	abstract = {A central organizing framework of the voluminous recent literature studying changes in the returns to skills and the evolution of earnings inequality is what we refer to as the canonical model, which elegantly and powerfully operationalizes the supply and demand for skills by assuming two distinct skill groups that perform two different and imperfectly substitutable tasks or produce two imperfectly substitutable goods. Technology is assumed to take a factor-augmenting form, which, by complementing either high or low skill workers, can generate skill biased demand shifts. In this paper, we argue that despite its notable successes, the canonical model is largely silent on a number of central empirical developments of the last three decades, including: (1) significant declines in real wages of low skill workers, particularly low skill males; (2) non-monotone changes in wages at different parts of the earnings distribution during different decades; (3) broad-based increases in employment in high skill and low skill occupations relative to middle skilled occupations (i.e., job 'polarization'); (4) rapid diffusion of new technologies that directly substitute capital for labor in tasks previously performed by moderately-skilled workers; and (5) expanding offshoring opportunities, enabled by technology, which allow foreign labor to substitute for domestic workers in specific tasks. Motivated by these patterns, we argue that it is valuable to consider a richer framework for analyzing how recent changes in the earnings and employment distribution in the United States and other advanced economies are shaped by the interactions among worker skills, job tasks, evolving technologies, and shifting trading opportunities. We propose a tractable task-based model in which the assignment of skills to tasks is endogenous and technical change may involve the substitution of machines for certain tasks previously performed by labor. We further consider how the evolution of technology in this task-based setting may be endogenized. We show how such a framework can be used to interpret several central recent trends, and we also suggest further directions for empirical exploration.},

	doi = {10.1257/jep.29.3.3},
	abstract = {In this essay, I begin by identifying the reasons that automation has not wiped out a majority of jobs over the decades and centuries. Automation does indeed substitute for laborâ��as it is typically intended to do. However, automation also complements labor, raises output in ways that leads to higher demand for labor, and interacts with adjustments in labor supply. Journalists and even expert commentators tend to overstate the extent of machine substitution for human labor and ignore the strong complementarities between automation and labor that increase productivity, raise earnings, and augment demand for labor. Changes in technology do alter the types of jobs available and what those jobs pay. In the last few decades, one noticeable change has been a "polarization" of the labor market, in which wage gains went disproportionately to those at the top and at the bottom of the income and skill distribution, not to those in the middle; however, I also argue, this polarization is unlikely to continue very far into future. The final section of this paper reflects on how recent and future advances in artificial intelligence and robotics should shape our thinking about the likely trajectory of occupational change and employment growth. I argue that the interplay between machine and human comparative advantage allows computers to substitute for workers in performing routine, codifiable tasks while amplifying the comparative advantage of workers in supplying problem-solving skills, adaptability, and creativity.},

Results show that: (1) the development of robotization in China is conducive to improving the skill structure, and the baseline conclusion still holds even though adopting multiple indexes of skill structure and controlling the endogeneity bias. (2) Robotization generates not only job displacement effect by displacing unskilled workers with robots but also structural transformation effect by increasing the proportion of technology-intensive industries, which can improve the skill structure. (3) In coastal provinces with strong Internet foundation, information transmission capacity and labour protection intensity, high labour cost and ageing rate, robotization plays a stronger role in improving the skill structure. Moreover, robotization can induce the employment polarization. These conclusions can help avoid technical unemployment and promote the upgrading of the skill structure in China.},

	title = {Regulating Transformative Technologies},
	abstract = {Transformative technologies like generative {AI} promise to accelerate productivity growth across many sectors, but they also present new risks from potential misuse. We develop a multi-sector technology adoption model to study the optimal regulation of transformative technologies when society can learn about these risks over time. Socially optimal adoption is gradual and typically convex. If social damages are large and proportional to the new technology’s productivity, a higher growth rate paradoxically leads to slower optimal adoption. Equilibrium adoption is inefficient when firms do not internalize all social damages, and sector-independent regulation is helpful but generally not sufficient to restore optimality.},

In a representative sample of the {US} workforce, we elicit the perceived fear of losing one’s job to robots or artiﬁcial intelligence. We document a strong relationship between fear of automation and intentions to join a union, retrain and switch occupations, preferences for higher taxation, higher government handouts, populist attitudes, and voting intentions. We then show a causal eﬀect of providing information about job loss probabilities on preferred levels of taxation and handouts. In contrast, our information treatment does not aﬀect workers’ intentions to self-insure by retraining or switching occupations, but it increases workers’ self-reported likelihood of joining a union to seek more job protection. The treatment eﬀects are mostly driven by workers who are informed about larger job loss probabilities than they perceived.},

This paper builds a framework where capital inputs advance through (1) increased automation, and (2) increased productivity. The interplay of these two innovation dimensions can produce balanced growth, satisfying the Uzawa Growth Theorem even though technological progress is capital-embodied. The framework can further address structural transformation, general purpose technologies, the limited macroeconomic impact of computing, and declining productivity growth and labor shares. Overall, this tractable framework can help resolve puzzling tensions between micro-level observations of innovation and balanced growth, while providing new perspectives on numerous macroeconomic phenomena.},

The optimal mechanism features moving goalposts: an initial disclosure makes the agent sufficiently optimistic that the task is easy. If the task is indeed difficult, the agent is told this only after working long enough to put the difficult task within reach. The agent then completes the difficult task even though he never would have chosen to at the outset.},
